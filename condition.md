## Condition

Specifies a Boolean expression that has a value of TRUE, FALSE, or null.

The value of *condition* is a Boolean (logical) expression. Boolean expressions can include comparison operators and the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT. Boolean expressions involving nulls can evaluate to null. Any Boolean expression whose result is null behaves as if it evaluated to FALSE.
