# SQL Functions

Functions can be used in the following SQL statements:

- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE 
- DELETE
- WHILE
- IF

Scalar functions take single-valued expressions as their argument. Aggregate functions take a set of values (for example, the contents of a column in a table) as their argument. Aggregate functions cannot be used in IF or WHILE statements.
