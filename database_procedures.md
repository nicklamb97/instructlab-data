# Database Procedures

A *database procedure* is a data-oriented procedure stored in the database and executed within the database server that you can call by name in a script or 4GL procedure. Database procedures are often used to increase performance and help ensure data integrity and consistency.

To use a database procedure in an OpenROAD application:

1. Create the procedure using the Database Procedure Editor
2. Register it with the OpenROAD Workbench

For instructions about how to register a database procedure, see the *Workbench User Guide*.

For more information about calling database procedures in OpenROAD, see Calling Procedures.
